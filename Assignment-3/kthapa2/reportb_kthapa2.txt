This file contains data regarding the problems given in Part- B of the assignment in order wise.


1. Determine the sentiment of each tweet
    Please find enclosed "tweet_sentiment_kthapa2.py" containing python code.

    Here are the top 10 and bottom 10 tweets along with their sentiment score.
    Top 10 Tweets:
    [10.0] : ['I know some brilliant people. Some of them are doing their thing tomorrow - best of luck guys. @ActingCDT GR16']
    [9.0] : ['@REAL_Jahir \n\nShots 4 \nGoals 0\nPassing Acc. 93%\nPasses 64\nChances created 1\nAeriels won 0\nDribbles won 4\nTackles won 1\nTouches 87.']
    [9.0] : ["I've got a maths exam this week, could I have a good luck tweet please? It'd make my really happy! I love you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @jacquelineMjos"]
    [9.0] : ['RT @R5_Janaaa: I love love love her eyes‚ù§ https://t.co/lVwvJueUIt']

    Bottom 10 Tweets:
    [-9.0] : ["RT @ShannonJessie: I can't fuckin stand cheap ass niggas ."]
    [-9.0] : ['Honestly fucking hate Facebook "300 likes and he will get his head shaved!" Hahaha honestly get the fuck off me pedos']

    [-12.0] : ['RT @harleyfriesen_: I fucking hate cancer fuck you']


    Implementation Details:

    For this part, I am first storing the sentiment scores of each word or phrase provided in the sentiment file which is AFINN-111.txt.
    Then I am reading the streaming_output_full_kthapa2.txt file and processing all tweets by parsing them as JSON object.
    Then I am extracting the "text" part of each tweet and using the split() method, I am splitting the words in "text" field of each tweet
    and calculating the sentiment score of each tweet by adding the sentiment scores of individual words. Finally I am printing the top 10
    tweets with sentiment scores and bottom 10 tweets with sentiment scores.


2. Happiest Breaking Bad Actor
    Please find the enclosed "happiest_actor_kthapa2.py" python code file.

    Average sentiment score for each actor is:

    [1.33] : ['mrbobodenkirk']
    [1.0909090909090908] : ['quiethandfilms']
    [1.0309278350515463] : ['RjMitte']
    [0.8979591836734694] : ['Krystenritter']
    [0.7849462365591398] : ['aaronpaul_8']
    [0.75] : ['betsy_brandt']
    [0.75] : ['deanjnorris']
    [0.71] : ['BryanCranston']
    [0.6161616161616161] : ['CharlesEbaker']
    [0.4020618556701031] : ['DanielMoncada80']
    [0.16666666666666666] : ['LuisMoncada77']
    [-0.09375] : ['mattjonesisdead']

    Implementation Details:

    For this part, first I am storing the sentiment scores provided in AFINN-111.txt into a static set.
    Then I am reading the breaking_bad_tweets_kthapa2.csv file and prcoessing the data into a map which contains
    the user name of each actor as the key and sentiment score of all the tweets as the value by iterating over the
    csv file data. I am also storing another map which contains the user name as the key and number of tweets as the
    value for that user name to calculate the average sentiment score of each actor.
    Finally I am printing all the user names and their respective sentiment scores.


3. Happiest State
    Please find the enclosed "happiest_state_kthapa2.py" file containing python code.

    Here are the top 5 happiest states and unhappiest states along with their frequencies.

    Top 5 happiest states:

    [2.000000] : [NV]
    [1.000000] : [WV]
    [1.000000] : [IA]
    [0.812500] : [TX]
    [0.666667] : [NC]

    Top 5 unhappiest states:

    [-1.000000] : [UT]
    [-1.000000] : [HI]
    [-2.000000] : [GA]
    [-3.000000] : [WI]
    [-5.000000] : [IN]

    Implementation Details:

    For this part, first I am storing the sentiment scores provided in AFINN-111.txt into a static set.
    then I am reading the streaming_output_full_kthapa2.txt file and parsing each tweet into a JSON object.
    Then from that JSON object, I am checking, if the "place_type" field is "city", then I am splitting the
    "full_name" field and storing the value at the last position of that array. Since that value is automatically in
    abbreviated form, so there is no need to process it.
    For the "place_type" as "admin", I am taking the value at first position of that "full_name" field, and then
    using the static state name abbreviation map, I am checking the name of that state into that map and getting the
    abbreviated name as value for that state.
    Then after getting the states, in another dictionary, I am storing the sentiment score of each state and in another
    dictionary, I am storing the tweet count of each state. Using these two fields, I am calculating the average sentiment
    score of each state. Finally I am printing the top 5 and bottom top 5 sentiment scores of each state along with
    the state abbreviated name.
